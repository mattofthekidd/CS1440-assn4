/*
 * The Deck class, as a minimum, must be able to do the following:
a. Construct a deck object given the size of the cards, number of cards, and the
maximum numbers in a bingo number set
b. A destructor that frees up all dynamically allocated memory associated with the
deck
c. A method to print whole deck to an output stream
d. A method to print a specific card in the deck to an output stream
 */

// The typically size is 5, but weâ€™ll allow card to vary in size from 3 to 15.

// The numbers of cards come from a bingo number set that contains every number from 1 to M, where M is a user-specified max between
// 2*N2 and 4*N2. The number of cards in the deck in a user-specified value between 3 and
// 10000.
